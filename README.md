# Simple React JSON editor with built-in SHA256 checksum support

Functions as a simple JSON editor with the ability to edit fields and save to a file.  Uses react-redux to manage JSON state with a left half edit panel and a right half preview panel.  Automatically updates a sha256 hash on the .checksum value of the JSON (calculated by empty checksum on formatted JSON).
